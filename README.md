No Bool Sheet
===

So, one Sunday morning in November 2018, I woke up, and started thinking in shower - how would I name my IT company?
I was already sick and tried of IT companies and methodologies I participated before.
So I wanted company name to represent that me as programmer, will do code by best practices, but proper, valid code approaches, with no workarounds, hacks, legacy code, strictly following rules from frontend libraries/frameworks, no bullshit.

Yeah, No Bool Sheet :)

- `No` meaning, I know bad practices in existed IT companies development lifecycle, so I say "No" to it and to people who constantly think it's OK. It's not fucking OK.
- `Bool` meaning, that in code, I will not fake anything what behaves as it is. I will not use polyfills, or substitute libraries, of mocking code behavior.
- `Sheet` meaning, that Google SpreadSheet is really great product for me, and I use it very frequent for different purposes. Tables helped not only me but lot of people, and this is bright example how product should behave - simple, intuitive, and useful.
